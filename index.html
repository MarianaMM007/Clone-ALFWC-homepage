            <h1>Grace & Peace!</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>One of the amazing things about God’s word is that it serves multiple functions in our lives. For example, Psalms 119:105 says, “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” (KJV). In just one verse of scripture, God’s word provides illumination for both our present and our future all at one time!</p>
            <p>The lamp “feature” of the word of God highlights our current position – spiritually, relationally, emotionally, and so on. In order for us to be and do all that God has planned for us, we must first take inventory of where we are in the various facets of our life. Maybe we are feeling anxious and fearful in some areas, and then perhaps relatively strong in other areas. Regardless of our position, it is the word of God that sheds light on the condition of our soul at any given time. And self-awareness is probably the most important competency we need for success.</p>
            <p>Next, once we are assured of where we are, the word of God then provides illumination for the path that we must travel. Though the path may be uncertain to us, it most assuredly is known to our Father. Therefore, it is upon His guidance that we must depend to make our way prosperous.</p>
            <p>At Abundant Life Family Worship Church, 2023 has been marked as the “Year of Discovery” – discovery of our God, ourselves, and others. We know that discovery in any venture can be scary. Yet, with the lamp and light of the word of God we are never alone and promised to have all the support we need. <br>
            So, what will you discover in 2023? Whatever it is, we are excited about your future and pray that this year of discovery will be your best one yet!</p>
            <p>We are happy to share our services are now being held online AND in person every Thursday@7:30pm & Sunday@10am. Feel free to join us in person or engage with us via Facebook and YouTube. If you live out of State and would like to join the church, our AChurch is still made available to you.</p>
            <p>So, however you choose to engage with us, stay connected and be fearless in your continued discovery of your God and yourself!</p>
            <p>Grace & Peace,</p>
